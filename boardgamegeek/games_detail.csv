The fighting began in the Ossetia (the primary Georgian target) and quickly spread to all of Georgia and Abkhazia.<br/><br/>At first glance this seems like a fight between David and Goliath - the vast Russian military against a state with only about 20,000 active duty personnel in it's military and only 7 combat jets - but closer examination reveals it was a somewhat stiffer competition with several points of interest.  It was with this thought that this game was inspired.<br/><br/>The game is relatively straight forward to learn and play and the system, while adapted to the conflict, very familiar to most wargamers.

The people who make the decisions and cut the paychecks have been made into symbols of greed and of ferocity.  In Lords of Baseball, you will take on the role of one of these owners.  You will need to build an entire organization, not just a Major League team.<br/><br/>Baseball Hall-of-Famer Tommy Lasorda once said of the game, &quot;No matter how good you are, you're going to lose one-third of your games.  No matter how bad you are you're going to win one-third of your games.  It's the other third that makes the difference.&quot;<br/><br/>In Lords of Baseball, your record is based on this principle.  Do you have what it takes to sustain a dynasty?  Will you build your team through trades or through a strong farm system?  With multiple paths to victory, Lords of Baseball will give you that chance.  It&rsquo;s not only about winning the World Series, it&rsquo;s also about doing the little things that will help you score Victory Points and at the end of 20 years make you the Lord of Baseball.<br/><br/>Lords of Baseball is a card driven game where players take control of a fictional organization and build it from the ground up.  They will invest money into a Farm System, Front Office, and Field Manager in an attempt to build a dynasty.  Over the course of 5 seasons, owners will use these investments to score Victory Points.  These investments will not only score VP's for owners, but also give them certain privileges during game play.<br/><br/>Each year is broken down into 4 phases: The Off season, The Early Season, Middle Season, and Late Season.  During each off season, owners will be required to pay player's and Manager's salaries, invest in the Farm System and Front Office, as well as make player personnel decisions.  These player decisions will go a long way towards seeing how well the team fares during the season.  During the season, owners will play card events or card OPS to decide their team records for each phase.  The cards are built similarly to many other CDG's in that cards have two event options on them.  Cards have one event that can be played during the off-season and one that can be played during the season.  These cards also have OP values that work in conjunction with players on the team to generate wins.<br/><br/>If the team with the best record has enough wins to win the pennant, that team moves on to a World Series phase that allows them to earn more VP.<br/><br/>The game lasts a predetermined number of seasons and the owner with the most VP at the end of the fifth season is declared the Lord of Baseball.<br/><br/>Components List<br/><br/>Rulebook<br/>4 Chart books<br/>1 Main Board<br/>4 Player Team Mats<br/>144 Player Cards<br/>20 Offseason Cards<br/>48 Cubes (12 in each color)<br/>4 VP Pawns<br/>2 Ten-Sided Dice<br/><br/>",2,4,150,90,150,10,"Campaign / Battle Card Driven,Hand Management,Trading",NaN,"Card Game,Economic,Sports","0,0,0,1,0",5,6.4,0,2,0,32,81,8,1,4

Each player represent one of five noble families attempting to build status for their family. Status is achieved by accumulating fiefs, money, history cards in sets (which include such things as Queens, scientists, cultural personalities, palaces, commanders, etc.), troops and merchants.<br/><br/>The game is driven by event cards ... and there are a ton of 'em. On a turn, a player draws and event card and can play as many of them as he sees fit (whether during his turn or not). Thus, the game becomes a series of various events, usually aiding the player and/or hurting his opponents in some fashion.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Svea Rike: Batalj<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",2,5,120,120,120,12,"Area Control / Area Influence,Card Drafting",Strategy Games,"Civilization,Economic","0,0,0,9,2",478,6.35776,5.76507,663,21,28,35,144,35,2.5143
